# Gmsh

The original files were copied from `share/doc/gmsh/tutorials` directory from Gmsh installation directory.  During the course of the tutorials I have edited and most likely cleaned-up/minified the files because that is part of my learning methodology.

## Topics

1. [Geometry basics, elementary entities, physical groups](t1.geo)

1. [Transformations, extruded geometries, volumes](t2.geo)
    - Getting coordinates of points
    - How to export an unrolled geometry file
